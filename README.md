## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
 With the advancement of artificial intelligence technologies, AI-driven real-time monitoring systems have emerged as a promising solution to enhance the safety and well-being of elderly individuals in nursing homes. In this project, we develop an AI-powered Smart Elderly Monitoring and Alert System capable of detecting falls, prolonged immobility, and abnormal jitter movements in real time and triggering timely alerts. 
 
 Our methodology integrates YOLOv8 for object detection, OpenPose for posture estimation, and LSTM/Transformer models for behavior analysis, complemented by FFT/Wavelet Transform techniques for jitter detection and KNN-based background subtraction to reduce false alarms. A key feature of our system is its modular design, allowing for flexible integration and scalable deployment across varied environments. Furthermore, a lightweight web-based interface is developed to ensure real-time user interaction, enabling caregivers to receive alerts and view detection logs efficiently.

We trained and validated our models through extensive experiments, achieving promising results in detection accuracy. This system provides timely interventions, enhances elderly care, and demonstrates practical deployment potential in both clinical and residential settings.
